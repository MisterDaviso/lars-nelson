* Plan Ahead
    * An online school website that allows teachers to create classes and assignments and for students to sign up for those classes and view those assignments. Features complex database manipulation and user freedom.
    * This was a group project, and my contribution was the entirety of the server-side code. I built the models with input from my teammates and updated them as new information became necessary to store. Multiple complex routes became necessary as more complex operations were required to ensure smoother user experiences on the front end.
