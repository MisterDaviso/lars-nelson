## Teach Machines to Check

A simple neural network designed to find an algorithm that can play checkers built entirely in python. The code determines every possible move on a given turn and then condenses that information into a readable format for the algorithm which then chooses the most optimal move among them.

This was my final project as General Assembly. It required an understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and data manipulation. The former two allowed me to create an algorithm without the use of TensorFlow and the later I learned as I went through three iterations of structuring the board data for the algorithm to use.
