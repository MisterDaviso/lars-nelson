## [Underground Combat](https://github.com/MisterDaviso/project-one-underground-combat)
A turn-based combat rpg built using the Phaser 3 API. Features multiple win conditions, varied gameplay, and modular encounters. The game is styled after the game "Undertale" by Toby Fox. 

The first three days were just spent learning Phaser 3. This allowed actual production to be fast-tracked and in fact allowed for more time to debug and add features than might otherwise have been possible building the project out piece by piece.
